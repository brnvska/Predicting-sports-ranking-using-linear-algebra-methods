In this application of linear algebra, we decided to look into how different linear algebra methods could predict how well sports teams would do by the end of the season. More specifically, we researched methods that could estimate the final rankings of sports teams so that we could utilize these results to predict which football team would win the English Premier League (EPL). Traditionally, sports rankings have been based on simple metrics such as win-loss records, point differentials, and other easily measurable statistics. However, as the field of sports analytics has evolved, more advanced methods have been developed to provide more accurate and reliable rankings. Linear algebra is one such method that has gained popularity in recent years as a tool for predicting sports rankings. Linear algebra methods allow analysts to analyze large sets of data and make predictions based on the results
